NoÌˆrmalizes UTF-8 input to Normalization Form C.

== Description ==

For everyone getting this warning from W3C validator: "Text run is not in Unicode Normalization Form C."

See: http://www.w3.org/International/docs/charmod-norm/#choice-of-normalization-form

For best performance have the PHP Internationalization extension "intl" installed, which includes the PHP class Normalizer.

See: http://php.net/manual/en/intro.intl.php and http://php.net/manual/en/intl.installation.php

However the claim is that this version should work without the PHP Internationalization extension being installed, or if your installation
is without UTF-8 for PCRE, or if you're running PHP 5.2, or if you're using IE8...

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't see any changes. =

The plugin just adds the normalization if there are problematic characters. Furthermore it does do the normalization before saving, so you don't see anything. It just works if it is needed.

= Will this slow down my site? =

Sorry, but I don't have a clue. Maybe just a little bit. 

== Screenshots ==

1. Correct transliteration if you enter the word directly
2. Missing transliteration for copy/pasted word from PDF
